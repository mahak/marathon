    * b) goals - it's not enough to check instance condition e.g. if the new instance task FAILED but the goal is
    *            Goal.Running then it will be automatically rescheduled by the TaskLauncherActor
    * c) condition - we additionally check whether or not the instance is considered terminal/active
    *
    * What makes it so hard to work with, is the fact, that it basically counts old and new instances and the additional
    * dimensions are expressed through filters on the [[InstanceChanged]] events. It can be a more robust state-machine
    * which ideally has a set of new and old instances which then decommissions old ones and schedules new ones, never
    * incrementing/decrementing counters and never over/under scales.
